# Expectations

Expectations are a statement about what results we expect a tool to produce.

Expectations allow you to:

- check coordinates based on bounding box, centroid, or temporal span
- check event duration, bandwidth, or label
- check meta features like event count, check for no events, or check for no extra events


## Expectation types

There are two expectation types, `event` tests and `segment` test. 

All expectations can be given a `name` and can be negated via the match property:

```yaml
expect:
    - name: "a name for a test"
      match:  false  
```

Both `name` and `match` can be omitted (and usually are).

```yaml
expect:
    - 
```

`match`'s default value is `true`. Use `match: false` to negate whatever test 
you're doing.

This will ensure we find a _a noisy airplane_:

```yaml
expect:
    - label: a noisy airplane
```

And now our test will fail if we find a _a noisy airplane_:

```yaml
expect:
    - match:  false  
      label: a noisy airplane
```

 ## Segment tests

Segment tests look for patterns in the results.
If you want to find a particular event, use an [event test](#event-tests) instead.

Segment tests that are available:

### No Events: `no_events`

No Events simply checks that a given test produced no events.

It only makes sense to use this expectation by itself.

```yaml
expect:
    - segment_with: no_events
```

### Events count: `event_count`

Event Count checks that a given test produced at least `count` events.

You can combine this expectation with other expectations.

```yaml
expect:
    - segment_with: event_count
      count: 3
```

### No Other Events: `no_other_events`

No other events ensures that after any _event expectations_ have been checked,
that there are no extra events remaining.

This expectation **should** be combined with other expectations



```yaml
expect:
    - segment_with: no_other_events
    - segment_with: no_other_events
```    

Using `no_other_events` by itself would have the same affect as the
`no_events` expectation.

```yaml
expect:
    - segment_with: no_other_events
```    

## Event tests

Event tests look for distinct results. We call them events because that's usually
what an acoustic recognizer produces. They don't _have_ to be acoustic events though.

Rather, an event should be:
  - an individual result
  - withing the analyzed segment
  - that can be located by coordinates
  - an ideally has some kind of _label_ or classification

There are three way to match an event: `bounds`, `centroid`, and by `time`.
At least one set of coordinates must be used.
Only one set of coordinates can be used at a time.

### Common properties

Each of the `bounds`, `centroid`, and by `time` expectations can include any of 
the following properties:

- `label` - a textual label/tag/classification of the result
- `duration` - check the duration of an event
- `bandwidth` - check the bandwidth of an event
- `index` - the expected index in the results file
- ðŸš§`condition` - check an arbitrary conditionðŸš§

All of these properties may be omitted. If they are then Egret does not check them.
Omit them unless you need to check for them specifically.

Example:

```yaml
expect:
  - label: boobook
    duration: ">15.0"
    bandwidth: "<1000"
    time: [ ">0", "<30" ]
```

This above example means: 

> Find a result named _boobook_ with a duration of at least 15 seconds,
> and a bandwidth less than 1000 hertz, somewhere in the first 30 seconds
> of the test file.
 
###  Bounding box: `bounds`

A bounding box  is a rectangular region on a spectrogram (temporal and spectral bounds).
 
An event must use the `bounds` property in the _expectation_. A bounds
object must specify four coordinates (start, low, end, high). Each
can be any valid [number](./values.md#Numerics) type.


```yaml
expect:
  - bounds:
      start_seconds: 1.23
      low_hertz: 300
      end_seconds: 4.56
      high_hertz: 1600
```

There is a shortcut form that packs the four values into an array like `[start, low, end, high]`:

```yaml
expect:
  - bounds: [ 1.23, 300, 4.56, 1600 ]
```

The shortcut form is used the most frequently.


### Centroid: `centroid`

A centroid is a point on a spectrogram (temporal and spectral).
You can use it to match either:

- the geometric center of an expectation to a result event
- or, to expect a match to a point-like event result

An event must use the `centroid` property in the _expectation_. A centroid
object must specify two coordinates (start, low). Each
can be any valid [number](./values.md#Numerics) type.


```yaml
expect:
  - centroid:
      start_seconds: 1.23
      low_hertz: 300
```

There is a shortcut form that packs the two values into an array like `[start, low]`:

```yaml
expect:
  - centroid: [ 1.23, 300 ]
```

The shortcut form is used the most frequently.



- temporal range only: `[start, ~, end]`, `[start, ~, end, ~]`

### Time: `time`

A time is a temporal band of time.
You can use it to:

- match events that were detected from a waveform (and thus have no frequency information)
- match events from a spectrogram for which the frequency information is irrelevant
- match machine learning events (most results only output temporal coordinates for matches)


An event must use the `time` property in the _expectation_. A time
object must specify two coordinates (start, end). Each
can be any valid [number](./values.md#Numerics) type.


```yaml
expect:
  - time:
      start_seconds: 1.23
      end_seconds: 300
```

There is a shortcut form that packs the two values into an array like `[start, end]`:

```yaml
expect:
  - time: [ 1.23, 4.56 ]
```

The shortcut form is used the most frequently.
